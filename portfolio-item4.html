            <p>As part of the Andela Build for SDG Innovation Challenge compettion of which my team and I played a part, we were challenged to provide a digital solution that 
                tackles any of the 17 SDG's.
            </p>
            <p>The idea came about due to some challenges one of our Friends's in the northern part of Ghana was facing at the Hospital. He complained about the inability to keep track of items that where mostly in and out of stock
                and this was making his job difficult. So my team and I decided to build a digital tool that will keep track of items available and notify the rightful authorities when items were running out of stock.
            </p>
          
            <p> The STOCK TRACKER app as we named it is a inventory system that will help hospitals, clinics and other health institutions to keep track of stocks of drugs and non-drugs so as to make informed decision regarding the purchasing of new items, drawing budgets and basically general overview of stocks available.
                This app was built was built by a team of 5 where I was their leader and was connected to SDG 3 (Good health and well being). 
            </p>
            <p>Technologies used where <strong>React JS,Graph QL,Postgresql and Nest JS framework</strong> </p><p>I developed the views(Frontend) for the various features of the app.This is the link to the app        <a href="https://stock-tracker01.netlify.app/#/" class="footer__link">stock-tracker01.netlify.app</a></p>
